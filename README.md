# Pythesia
A midi synth written in python. PLease note that at this stage it is a proof of concept and there are some bugs, however, you can see what you play on your keyboard and you can play songs from midi files!

# Setup
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. open gui.py with a text editor
3. search for "/home/haywire/midi/" and replace it with your midi folder.
4. start the program: `python gui.py`
5. IMPORTANT: select a midi in and out first! (will fix this in the future)
6. you can play a specific song (program will search for a similar file) or play random songs or visualize your input.
